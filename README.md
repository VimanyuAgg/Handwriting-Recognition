# Handwriting-Recognition

This project uses logistic regression and neural networks to recognize handwritten digits (from 0 to 9). As logistic regression cannot
form more complex hypotheses as it is only a linear classifier, The neural network is used to represent complex models that form non-linear hy-potheses. Backpropagation algorithm has been used for learning the neural network parameters.
